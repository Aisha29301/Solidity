# Solidity

Solidity is used for implementing smart contracts which is created by the Ethereum.

- hello_world : first program of every programming language
- datatype : dicussed about the datatypes present in solidity
- counter : checks increment and decrement functionality and gas amount deducted when value is changed but when only to view no gas amount is deducted
- enumerated : Enums are user-defined data types that restrict the variable to have only one of the predefined values.
- structure : Structure are collection of different datatype and can be used inside mappings and arrays and they can themselves contain mappings and arrays.
- view_pure : view and pure are built-in functionality given solidity to save gas amount. view function declares that no state will be changed. pure function declares no state will be changed or read.
- infoGas : DO NOT RUN THIS CODE IT IS INFINITE LOOP CODE WHICH WILL DRAINED OUR ACCOUNT WRITTEN FOR TESTING PURPOSE ONLY
- ether_units : wei = 1 wei,
                Kwei = 1e3 wei, 
                Mwei = 1e6 wei, 
                Gwei = 1e9 wei, 
                microether = 1e12 wei, 
                milliether = 1e15 wei, 
                ether = 1e18 wei
